# Music-Store-Analysis-SQL-Project-Data-Analysis

In this project, I focused on analyzing an online music store's database using SQL. Designed for beginners, it provides hands-on experience in querying and examining a music playlist dataset. The aim is to derive insights that can help the store understand its business growth by addressing various analytical questions.

Utilizing PostgreSQL and PgAdmin 4, I explored data related to music sales, customer behavior, and trends within the music industry. Through practical exercises, I identified key metrics such as top customers, popular music genres, and revenue-generating cities.

This project serves as a valuable resource for anyone looking to enhance their SQL skills while gaining insights into the digital music industry.
